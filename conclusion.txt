## Conclusion
The project has made significant progress with a solid foundation in place. The authentication system is working correctly, and the Setup Module is fully functional. The Clients Module has been substantially enhanced with complete CRUD operations for clients and entities, as well as comprehensive entity configuration capabilities for services and tax jurisdictions. 

The Tasks Module has been extensively developed with a complete implementation of both Administrative and Revenue task creation flows. The Administrative Task form is fully functional, and the Revenue Task form now features all three tabs as specified in the PRD: Basic Information, Compliance Configuration, and Invoice Information. 

The Compliance Configuration tab is now complete with support for multiple frequency options, dynamic fields based on selection, and automatic end date calculation. The Invoice Information tab is also fully implemented with auto-populated values from services. The cascading dropdowns now correctly display selected values and maintain their state throughout the form interaction process.

Future development will focus on implementing task editing, deletion, status changes, and the recurring tasks feature. Additional modules planned include dashboard analytics, user management, client portal access, and invoice/payment tracking.
