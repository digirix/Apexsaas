3. **Multi-Tenant**: Always include tenantId in queries and session validation
4. **Error Handling**: User-friendly messages with professional appearance
5. **UI Consistency**: Shadcn/UI components with consistent styling patterns

### Technical Debt to Address:
- Some LSP errors in queryClient.ts need type fixes
- Database migration strategy needs documentation
- Component performance optimization opportunities exist
- Test coverage needs significant improvement

### AI Integration Opportunities:
- Service recommendation engine is the highest priority AI feature
- Task detail suggestions should follow service recommendations
- Compliance risk prediction has high business value
- Financial insights and analytics represent major value-add potential

This TODO list is prioritized based on business value, user requirements from Full Scope, and current completion status. The immediate focus should be on completing core functionality before moving to advanced features.
