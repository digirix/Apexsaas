# Project Progress Report: Accounting Firm Management Application

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the progress made on the Accounting Firm Management Application, a multi-tenant system designed for accounting firms to manage clients, tasks, and system configuration.

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: React, TanStack Query, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Authentication: Passport.js, bcrypt, JWT

### Key Components
- Authentication system (login/signup/logout)
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Setup Module (configuration management)
- Clients Module
- Tasks Module

## Completed Work

### Database Schema and Data Models
- Comprehensive data schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`
- Models include:
  - Tenants: Multi-tenant support for accounting firms
  - Users: Authentication and user management
  - Countries: Country configuration for clients
  - Currencies: Currency configuration for billing
  - States/Provinces: Geographical sub-divisions
  - Entity Types: Legal entity types for clients (e.g., LLC, Corporation)
  - Task Statuses: Workflow states for tasks
  - Service Types: Services offered with billing rates
  - Clients: Client management
  - Entities: Legal entities owned by clients
  - Tasks: Work items assigned to clients/entities
  - Tax Jurisdictions: VAT/Sales tax jurisdictions for different regions
  - Entity Tax Jurisdictions: Link between entities and tax jurisdictions
  - Entity Service Subscriptions: Services subscribed by entities

### Authentication System
- User registration with firm creation (multi-tenant)
- Login/logout functionality
- Session management
- Route protection for authenticated routes
- User context and hooks for frontend

### Setup Module
- Complete implementation of the Setup Module with the following components:
  - Countries Manager: Add, edit, delete countries
  - Currencies Manager: Add, edit, delete currencies
  - States Manager: Add, edit, delete states/provinces with country relationship
  - Entity Types Manager: Add, edit, delete entity types with country relationship
  - Task Statuses Manager: Add, edit, delete task statuses with ordering
  - Service Types Manager: Add, edit, delete service types with rates and billing basis
  - Tax Jurisdictions Manager: Add, edit, delete tax jurisdictions with country and state

### Clients Module
- Implemented client listing with data table display
- Added client detail view with summary information
- Created client creation form with validation
- Added entity listing for each client
- Implemented entity creation modal with form validation
- Established relationships between clients and entities
- Added client and entity CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Implemented entity configuration for services and tax jurisdictions
- Added service subscription management for entities
- Implemented tax jurisdiction assignment for VAT-registered entities

### Entity Configuration Features
- Service Subscription: Allows marking services as "Required" and "Subscribed"
- Tax Jurisdiction Selection: For VAT-registered entities, enables selection of applicable tax jurisdictions
- File Access Link: Added URL field for external document access
- Business rules enforcement:
  - Services can only be subscribed if they are marked as required
  - Tax jurisdictions are only configurable for VAT-registered entities
  - Services are filtered by the entity's country

### API Routes
- Authentication endpoints (`/api/v1/auth/signup`, `/api/v1/auth/login`, `/api/v1/auth/logout`, `/api/v1/auth/me`)
- Setup endpoints:
  - Countries (`/api/v1/setup/countries`)
  - Currencies (`/api/v1/setup/currencies`)
  - States (`/api/v1/setup/states`)
  - Entity Types (`/api/v1/setup/entity-types`)
  - Task Statuses (`/api/v1/setup/task-statuses`)
  - Service Types (`/api/v1/setup/service-types`)
  - Tax Jurisdictions (`/api/v1/setup/tax-jurisdictions`)
- Client endpoints:
  - Clients CRUD (`/api/v1/clients`)
  - Entities CRUD (`/api/v1/clients/:clientId/entities`, `/api/v1/entities/:id`)
- Entity Configuration endpoints:
  - Entity Services (`/api/v1/entities/:entityId/services`)
  - Entity Tax Jurisdictions (`/api/v1/entities/:entityId/tax-jurisdictions`)

### Frontend Components
- Layout components (Sidebar, AppLayout)
- Form components with validation
- Table components for data display
- CRUD operations for all setup entities
- Modal dialogs for create/edit/delete operations
- Toast notifications
- Loading states and error handling
- Reusable DeleteConfirmationDialog for safe deletion of resources
- Edit modals for clients and entities
- Entity configuration modal with service subscriptions and tax jurisdictions

### Technical Challenges Addressed
- Resolved Select component empty string value issues in filters
- Fixed filter logic for entity types and service types to handle the "all" filter value
- Added proper validation for all form fields
- Implemented proper state management for complex forms (service types with custom billing basis)
- Ensured proper relationships between entities (country/state, country/entity type)
- Fixed error handling in API requests with unknown error types
- Implemented proper TypeScript typings for form values and API responses
- Optimized modal dialogs to properly reset form state on close
- Fixed subscription conflicts when updating entity services by ensuring they exist before attempting updates

## Current Development Logic Flow

### Client Module Flow
1. **Client Management:**
   - Clients list is displayed with client name, email, and status
   - Clients can be created through the Add Client modal
   - Clients can be viewed by clicking on a client card
   - Clients can be edited using the Edit Client modal
   - Clients can be deleted using the Delete Confirmation dialog

2. **Entity Management:**
   - Entities are listed within the client detail view
   - Entities can be created through the Add Entity modal
   - Entities are displayed with details like name, location, type, and tax information
   - Entity services and tax jurisdictions can be configured via the Entity Config modal
   - Entities can be edited using the Edit Entity modal
   - Entities can be deleted using the Delete Confirmation dialog

3. **Entity Configuration:**
   - Services tab: Lists all services available for the entity's country
   - Each service can be marked as "Required" and "Subscribed" (subscription requires the service to be required first)
   - Changes are persisted when the Save button is clicked
   - If the entity is VAT-registered, a Tax Jurisdictions tab is shown
   - Tax jurisdictions tab: Allows selection of applicable tax jurisdictions for the entity
   - Tax jurisdictions are filtered by the entity's country and state if applicable

4. **Business Rules:**
   - Service subscription requires the service to be marked as required first
   - Tax jurisdictions are only configurable for VAT-registered entities
   - Tax jurisdictions must match the entity's country
   - Entity types must match the entity's country
   - States must match the entity's country

## In Progress / Next Steps
- Task Module implementation
- Dashboard with analytics
- User management for firms
- Client portal access management
- Advanced filtering and search functionality
- Reports and exports
- Client contact management
- Invoice and payment tracking

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Session-based authentication with Express Session
- Protected routes using custom React components

### Storage Implementation
- PostgreSQL database connection with environment variables
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Memory storage fallback for development

### Form Validation
- Zod schemas for request validation
- React Hook Form for frontend form management
- Server-side validation for API requests

### UI Components
- shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- Custom form components with validation
- Responsive design for all screens

### State Management
- React Query for server state
- React context for auth state
- Local state for UI components

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling in API requests
- User-friendly error messages in toast notifications
- Form validation errors displayed inline with fields

## Conclusion
The project has made significant progress with a solid foundation in place. The authentication system is working correctly, and the Setup Module is fully functional. The Clients Module has been substantially enhanced with complete CRUD operations for clients and entities, as well as comprehensive entity configuration capabilities for services and tax jurisdictions. The next major focus will be implementing the Tasks Module to complete the core functionality of the application, followed by the User Management and Client Portal features.
