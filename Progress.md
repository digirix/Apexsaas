## Recent Development Highlights

### Client Portal Data Integration Fix - May 2025
Successfully resolved critical data loading issues in the Client Portal that prevented real service data from displaying:

1. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Client portal was using a broken endpoint `/api/client-portal/entity/${entity.id}/services`
   - Storage instance mismatch between client portal routes and working admin portal
   - Database table reference errors causing "services table does not exist" failures

2. **Technical Solution**:
   - Updated client portal to use working admin endpoint `/api/v1/entities/${entity.id}/services`
   - Fixed storage initialization to use the same DatabaseStorage instance as admin portal
   - Implemented proper data flow from backend to frontend with real service configurations

3. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Client Portal now displays actual service data: Income Tax Return and Sales Tax Return services
