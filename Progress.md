# Project Progress Report: Accounting Firm Management Application

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the progress made on the Accounting Firm Management Application, a multi-tenant system designed for accounting firms to manage clients, tasks, and system configuration.

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: React, TanStack Query, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Express.js
- Database: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Authentication: Passport.js, bcrypt, JWT

### Key Components
- Authentication system (login/signup/logout)
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Setup Module (configuration management)
- Clients Module
- Tasks Module

## Completed Work

### Database Schema and Data Models
- Comprehensive data schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`
- Models include:
  - Tenants: Multi-tenant support for accounting firms
  - Users: Authentication and user management
  - Countries: Country configuration for clients
  - Currencies: Currency configuration for billing
  - States/Provinces: Geographical sub-divisions
  - Entity Types: Legal entity types for clients (e.g., LLC, Corporation)
  - Task Statuses: Workflow states for tasks
  - Service Types: Services offered with billing rates
  - Clients: Client management
  - Entities: Legal entities owned by clients
  - Tasks: Work items assigned to clients/entities

### Authentication System
- User registration with firm creation (multi-tenant)
- Login/logout functionality
- Session management
- Route protection for authenticated routes
- User context and hooks for frontend

### Setup Module
- Complete implementation of the Setup Module with the following components:
  - Countries Manager: Add, edit, delete countries
  - Currencies Manager: Add, edit, delete currencies
  - States Manager: Add, edit, delete states/provinces with country relationship
  - Entity Types Manager: Add, edit, delete entity types with country relationship
  - Task Statuses Manager: Add, edit, delete task statuses with ordering
  - Service Types Manager: Add, edit, delete service types with rates and billing basis

### API Routes
- Authentication endpoints (`/api/v1/auth/signup`, `/api/v1/auth/login`, `/api/v1/auth/logout`, `/api/v1/auth/me`)
- Setup endpoints:
  - Countries (`/api/v1/setup/countries`)
  - Currencies (`/api/v1/setup/currencies`)
  - States (`/api/v1/setup/states`)
  - Entity Types (`/api/v1/setup/entity-types`)
  - Task Statuses (`/api/v1/setup/task-statuses`)
  - Service Types (`/api/v1/setup/service-types`)
- Client endpoints (`/api/v1/clients`)

### Frontend Components
- Layout components (Sidebar, AppLayout)
- Form components with validation
- Table components for data display
- CRUD operations for all setup entities
- Modal dialogs for create/edit/delete operations
- Toast notifications
- Loading states and error handling

### Technical Challenges Addressed
- Resolved Select component empty string value issues in filters
- Fixed filter logic for entity types and service types to handle the "all" filter value
- Added proper validation for all form fields
- Implemented proper state management for complex forms (service types with custom billing basis)
- Ensured proper relationships between entities (country/state, country/entity type)

## In Progress / Next Steps
- Clients Module implementation
- Task Module implementation
- Dashboard with analytics
- User management for firms
- Advanced filtering and search functionality
- Reports and exports

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Session-based authentication with Express Session
- Protected routes using custom React components

### Storage Implementation
- PostgreSQL database connection with environment variables
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Memory storage fallback for development

### Form Validation
- Zod schemas for request validation
- React Hook Form for frontend form management
- Server-side validation for API requests

### UI Components
- shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- Custom form components with validation
- Responsive design for all screens

### State Management
- React Query for server state
- React context for auth state
- Local state for UI components

## Known Issues
- Session store TypeScript definition mismatches in `server/storage.ts`
- Unknown type errors in `server/auth.ts` related to user serialization

## Conclusion
The project has made significant progress with a solid foundation in place. The authentication system is working correctly, and the Setup Module is fully functional, allowing users to configure all necessary reference data for the application. Next steps include implementing the Clients and Tasks modules to complete the core functionality of the application.
