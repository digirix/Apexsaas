## Current Development Logic Flow

### Client Module Flow
1. **Client Management:**
   - Clients list is displayed with client name, email, and status
   - Clients can be created through the Add Client modal
   - Clients can be viewed by clicking on a client card
   - Clients can be edited using the Edit Client modal
   - Clients can be deleted using the Delete Confirmation dialog

2. **Entity Management:**
   - Entities are listed within the client detail view
   - Entities can be created through the Add Entity modal
   - Entities are displayed with details like name, location, type, and tax information
   - Entity services and tax jurisdictions can be configured via the Entity Config modal
   - Entities can be edited using the Edit Entity modal
   - Entities can be deleted using the Delete Confirmation dialog

3. **Entity Configuration:**
   - Services tab: Lists all services available for the entity's country
   - Each service can be marked as "Required" and "Subscribed" (subscription requires the service to be required first)
   - Changes are persisted when the Save button is clicked
   - If the entity is VAT-registered, a Tax Jurisdictions tab is shown
   - Tax jurisdictions tab: Allows selection of applicable tax jurisdictions for the entity
   - Tax jurisdictions are filtered by the entity's country and state if applicable

4. **Business Rules:**
   - Service subscription requires the service to be marked as required first
   - Tax jurisdictions are only configurable for VAT-registered entities
   - Tax jurisdictions must match the entity's country
   - Entity types must match the entity's country
   - States must match the entity's country

### Tasks Module Flow
1. **Task Management:**
   - Tasks are displayed in a filterable list view with columns for key information
   - Tasks can be filtered by status, assignee, and category for easier management
   - Two primary task types: Administrative and Revenue tasks
   - Administrative tasks are for internal firm purposes and have simplified form fields
   - Revenue tasks are linked to clients, entities, and services and include compliance and invoicing information

2. **Task Creation Process:**
   - Administrative Tasks:
     - Entry of basic task information (Task Type, Assignee, Due Date)
     - Optional selection of Administrative Task Category
     - Entry of Task Details and Next To Do information
     - On submission, task is created with status "New" (rank 1)
   
   - Revenue Tasks (Three-Tab Form):
     - Basic Information Tab:
       - Client selection (dropdown from client list)
       - Entity selection (dropdown filtered by selected client)
       - Service selection (dropdown filtered by selected entity's subscribed services)
       - Task Category, Task Type, Assignee, Due Date, Task Details, Next To Do
     - Compliance Configuration Tab:
       - Compliance Frequency selection (5 Years to One Time)
       - Conditional Year(s) field (single year for Annual, comma-separated years for multi-year frequencies)
       - Dynamic Duration dropdown based on frequency (e.g., Q1-Q4 for Quarterly, Jan-Dec for Monthly)
       - Compliance Start Date with date picker
       - Auto-calculated End Date based on frequency and start date
       - Recurring task toggle for scheduling future task instances
     - Invoice Information Tab:
       - Currency auto-populated from entity's country (defaulting to USD in current implementation)
       - Service Rate auto-populated from selected service type
       - Both Currency and Service Rate remain editable for flexibility
### Users Module Flow
1. **User Management:**
   - Users are displayed in a list view with key information such as name, email, and active status
   - The SuperAdmin user (tenant owner) is visible in the list with a special indicator
   - Users can be added through the Add User modal with form validation
   - Users can be edited using the Edit User modal
   - Users can be deleted with confirmation dialog (except the current logged-in user)

2. **User Permissions:**
   - Each user can be assigned specific permissions for different modules
   - Permission control includes:
     - View permission: User can see the module
     - Create permission: User can add new items
     - Edit permission: User can modify existing items
     - Delete permission: User can remove items
   - Permissions are module-specific and can be configured granularly
   - SuperAdmin users automatically have all permissions

3. **Business Rules:**
   - Users belong to a specific tenant (accounting firm)
   - Each user can have department and designation assignments
   - Users cannot modify their own permissions
   - SuperAdmin permissions cannot be revoked or modified
   - Users can be deactivated without being deleted

4. **User Creation Flow:**
   - Multi-step wizard process with three tabs:
     - Step 1: Basic Information (Name, Department, Designation)
     - Step 2: Access Permissions (Module-by-module permission assignment)
     - Step 3: Credentials (Username, Email, Password, Active Status)
   - Username, display name, and email are required fields
   - Password must meet minimum security requirements (8+ characters)
   - Department and designation selections are optional
   - Active status is enabled by default
   - Upon creation, users are assigned permissions based on the configuration in step 2

5. **Permission Assignment Flow:**
   - Three-tier permission model per module:
     - Full Access: Automatically grants all CRUD permissions
     - Partial Access: Allows granular selection of individual permissions
     - Restricted Access: Denies all permissions for that module
   - For Partial Access, individual CRUD permissions can be toggled:
     - View (Read): User can see module content
     - Create: User can add new items
     - Edit (Update): User can modify existing items
     - Delete: User can remove items
   - Changes are saved immediately for each permission update
   - Module-specific access means a user might have full permissions in one area but limited in another
   - SuperAdmin users always have all permissions which cannot be modified

## Current Implementation Status

   - Implemented tabbed interface for Revenue tasks with Basic Info, Compliance Configuration, and Invoice Information sections
   - Added client-entity relationship filtering to show only relevant entities for selected clients

2. **Data Handling Improvements:**
   - Added support for dynamic loading of currencies from the Setup Module in both task creation and editing forms
   - Fixed the form schemas to properly validate and format data before submission
   - Implemented proper date handling for compliance start/end dates

3. **Task Details Component Enhancements:**

## Current Challenges
1. **Task Creation Type Mismatch:**
   - There's a type mismatch between the frontend forms and backend schema for some fields:
   - Frontend sends `taskCategoryId` as a string, but backend expects a number
   - Date fields need proper formatting before submission
   - Resolution: Need to update form submission logic to properly convert types

2. **Recurring Task Generation:**
   - The automatic generation of recurring tasks based on compliance frequency is not yet implemented
   - Need to create the "Auto Generated Tasks" module for approval workflow

3. **Task Status Transitions:**
   - Status workflow needs enhancement to enforce proper transitions between states
   - Need to implement business rules for status changes

## Next Development Steps
Future development will focus on:

1. **Tasks Module:**
   - Fix type mismatch issues in task creation/editing forms
   - Complete the recurring tasks feature with auto-generation functionality
   - Implement the "Auto Generated Tasks" approval workflow
   - Add task assignment notifications
   - Enhance filtering capabilities for the tasks list

2. **Users Module:**
