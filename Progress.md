## Current Development Logic Flow

### Client Module Flow
1. **Client Management:**
   - Clients list is displayed with client name, email, and status
   - Clients can be created through the Add Client modal
   - Clients can be viewed by clicking on a client card
   - Clients can be edited using the Edit Client modal
   - Clients can be deleted using the Delete Confirmation dialog

2. **Entity Management:**
   - Entities are listed within the client detail view
   - Entities can be created through the Add Entity modal
   - Entities are displayed with details like name, location, type, and tax information
   - Entity services and tax jurisdictions can be configured via the Entity Config modal
   - Entities can be edited using the Edit Entity modal
   - Entities can be deleted using the Delete Confirmation dialog

3. **Entity Configuration:**
   - Services tab: Lists all services available for the entity's country
   - Each service can be marked as "Required" and "Subscribed" (subscription requires the service to be required first)
   - Changes are persisted when the Save button is clicked
   - If the entity is VAT-registered, a Tax Jurisdictions tab is shown
   - Tax jurisdictions tab: Allows selection of applicable tax jurisdictions for the entity
   - Tax jurisdictions are filtered by the entity's country and state if applicable

4. **Business Rules:**
   - Service subscription requires the service to be marked as required first
   - Tax jurisdictions are only configurable for VAT-registered entities
   - Tax jurisdictions must match the entity's country
   - Entity types must match the entity's country
   - States must match the entity's country

### Tasks Module Flow
1. **Task Management:**
   - Tasks are displayed in a filterable list view with columns for key information
   - Tasks can be filtered by status, assignee, and category for easier management
   - Two primary task types: Administrative and Revenue tasks
   - Administrative tasks are for internal firm purposes and have simplified form fields
   - Revenue tasks are linked to clients, entities, and services and include compliance and invoicing information

2. **Task Creation Process:**
   - Administrative Tasks:
     - Entry of basic task information (Task Type, Assignee, Due Date)
     - Optional selection of Administrative Task Category
     - Entry of Task Details and Next To Do information
     - On submission, task is created with status "New" (rank 1)
   
   - Revenue Tasks (Three-Tab Form):
     - Basic Information Tab:
       - Client selection (dropdown from client list)
       - Entity selection (dropdown filtered by selected client)
       - Service selection (dropdown filtered by selected entity's subscribed services)
       - Task Category, Task Type, Assignee, Due Date, Task Details, Next To Do
     - Compliance Configuration Tab:
       - Compliance Frequency selection (5 Years to One Time)
       - Conditional Year(s) field (single year for Annual, comma-separated years for multi-year frequencies)
       - Dynamic Duration dropdown based on frequency (e.g., Q1-Q4 for Quarterly, Jan-Dec for Monthly)
       - Compliance Start Date with date picker
       - Auto-calculated End Date based on frequency and start date
       - Recurring task toggle for scheduling future task instances
     - Invoice Information Tab:
       - Currency auto-populated from entity's country (defaulting to USD in current implementation)
       - Service Rate auto-populated from selected service type
       - Both Currency and Service Rate remain editable for flexibility
### Users Module Flow
1. **User Management:**
   - Users are displayed in a list view with key information such as name, email, and active status
   - The SuperAdmin user (tenant owner) is visible in the list with a special indicator
   - Users can be added through the Add User modal with form validation
   - Users can be edited using the Edit User modal
   - Users can be deleted with confirmation dialog (except the current logged-in user)

2. **User Permissions:**
   - Each user can be assigned specific permissions for different modules
   - Permission control includes:
     - View permission: User can see the module
     - Create permission: User can add new items
     - Edit permission: User can modify existing items
     - Delete permission: User can remove items
   - Permissions are module-specific and can be configured granularly
   - SuperAdmin users automatically have all permissions

3. **Business Rules:**
   - Users belong to a specific tenant (accounting firm)
   - Each user can have department and designation assignments
   - Users cannot modify their own permissions
   - SuperAdmin permissions cannot be revoked or modified
   - Users can be deactivated without being deleted

4. **User Creation Flow:**
   - Username, display name, and email are required fields
   - Password must meet minimum security requirements
   - Department and designation selections are optional
   - Active status is enabled by default
   - Upon creation, users are assigned default permissions

5. **Permission Assignment Flow:**
   - Permissions are managed per module (Clients, Tasks, Setup, etc.)
   - Each permission type can be toggled independently
   - Changes are saved immediately for each permission update
   - Module-specific access means a user might have full permissions in one area but limited in another

## Current Implementation Status
The project has made significant progress across multiple modules:

1. **Core Infrastructure:**
   - Authentication system complete and functional
   - Multi-tenant architecture fully implemented with proper isolation

   - Integrating department and designation selections
   - Resolving issues with form submission in Add User modal

2. **System-wide:**
   - Ensuring proper tenant isolation across all operations
   - Implementing consistent error handling across the application
   - Managing complex state with multiple related entities
   - Handling cascading updates when parent entities change
   - Implementing proper TypeScript typings for all components and API responses

## Next Development Steps
Future development will focus on:

1. **Users Module:**
   - Fix the Add User button functionality issue
   - Complete the user permissions management interface
   - Add bulk permission operations
   - Implement user activity logging

2. **Tasks Module:**
   - Implement task editing and status changes
   - Complete the recurring tasks feature
   - Add task assignment notifications

3. **Additional Features:**
   - Dashboard analytics for firm performance
