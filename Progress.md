- Fixed error handling in API requests with unknown error types
- Implemented proper TypeScript typings for form values and API responses
- Optimized modal dialogs to properly reset form state on close
- Fixed subscription conflicts when updating entity services by ensuring they exist before attempting updates

## Current Development Logic Flow

### Client Module Flow
1. **Client Management:**
   - Clients list is displayed with client name, email, and status
   - Clients can be created through the Add Client modal
   - Clients can be viewed by clicking on a client card
   - Clients can be edited using the Edit Client modal
   - Clients can be deleted using the Delete Confirmation dialog

2. **Entity Management:**
   - Entities are listed within the client detail view
   - Entities can be created through the Add Entity modal
   - Entities are displayed with details like name, location, type, and tax information
   - Entity services and tax jurisdictions can be configured via the Entity Config modal
   - Entities can be edited using the Edit Entity modal
   - Entities can be deleted using the Delete Confirmation dialog

3. **Entity Configuration:**
   - Services tab: Lists all services available for the entity's country
   - Each service can be marked as "Required" and "Subscribed" (subscription requires the service to be required first)
   - Changes are persisted when the Save button is clicked
   - If the entity is VAT-registered, a Tax Jurisdictions tab is shown
   - Tax jurisdictions tab: Allows selection of applicable tax jurisdictions for the entity
   - Tax jurisdictions are filtered by the entity's country and state if applicable

4. **Business Rules:**
   - Service subscription requires the service to be marked as required first
   - Tax jurisdictions are only configurable for VAT-registered entities
   - Tax jurisdictions must match the entity's country
   - Entity types must match the entity's country
   - States must match the entity's country

### Tasks Module Flow
1. **Task Management:**
   - Tasks are displayed in a filterable list view with columns for key information
   - Tasks can be filtered by status, assignee, and category for easier management
   - Two primary task types: Administrative and Revenue tasks
   - Administrative tasks are for internal firm purposes and have simplified form fields
   - Revenue tasks are linked to clients, entities, and services and include compliance and invoicing information

2. **Task Creation Process:**
   - Administrative Tasks:
     - Entry of basic task information (Task Type, Assignee, Due Date)
     - Optional selection of Administrative Task Category
     - Entry of Task Details and Next To Do information
     - On submission, task is created with status "New" (rank 1)
   
   - Revenue Tasks (Three-Tab Form):
     - Basic Information Tab:
       - Client selection (dropdown from client list)
       - Entity selection (dropdown filtered by selected client)
       - Service selection (dropdown filtered by selected entity's subscribed services)
       - Task Category, Task Type, Assignee, Due Date, Task Details, Next To Do
     - Compliance Configuration Tab (planned):
       - Compliance Frequency selection
       - Year/Duration specification based on frequency
       - Compliance Start/End Dates
       - Recurring task configuration
     - Invoice Information Tab (planned):
       - Currency (auto-populated from entity/service)
       - Service Rate (auto-populated with option to modify)

3. **Task Status Flow:**
   - Tasks are created with the "New" status (rank 1)
   - Status changes follow the rank ordering defined in the Setup module
   - Completion moves tasks to the "Completed" status (highest rank)

4. **Data Dependencies and Cascading Logic:**
   - Entity dropdown is filtered based on the selected client
   - Service dropdown is filtered based on the selected entity
   - When client selection changes, both entity and service selections are reset
   - When entity selection changes, service selection is reset
   - Form fields are appropriately disabled until their parent selection is made

5. **Current Implementation Status:**
   - Task List component with filters implemented
   - Add Task Modal with both Administrative and Revenue task forms
   - Basic form validation for all required fields
   - Tabs for Revenue tasks (Basic Information tab functional)
   - Status filtering functionality
   - Form cascading dependencies for client->entity->service
   - Task creation API integration

6. **Technical Challenges:**
   - Managing cascading dropdown dependencies properly
   - Ensuring proper reset of dependent fields when parent selections change
   - Handling form validation across multiple tabs
   - Correctly managing the empty and loading states for dynamic dropdown contents
   - Entity selection not properly displaying the selected value
   - Service dropdown not showing available services correctly

## In Progress / Next Steps

## Conclusion
The project has made significant progress with a solid foundation in place. The authentication system is working correctly, and the Setup Module is fully functional. The Clients Module has been substantially enhanced with complete CRUD operations for clients and entities, as well as comprehensive entity configuration capabilities for services and tax jurisdictions. 

The Tasks Module is currently under development with the basic functionality for task listing and creation implemented. The Administrative Task form is complete and functional, while the Revenue Task form is still being refined to address dropdown selection issues related to entity and service fields. The implementation of the Compliance Configuration and Invoice Information tabs is pending, along with edit/delete functionality for tasks. Future phases will include recurring tasks, dashboard analytics, and client portal access.
