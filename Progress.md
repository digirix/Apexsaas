## Current Development Logic Flow

### Client Module Flow
1. **Client Management:**
   - Clients list is displayed with client name, email, and status
   - Clients can be created through the Add Client modal
   - Clients can be viewed by clicking on a client card
   - Clients can be edited using the Edit Client modal
   - Clients can be deleted using the Delete Confirmation dialog

2. **Entity Management:**
   - Entities are listed within the client detail view
   - Entities can be created through the Add Entity modal
   - Entities are displayed with details like name, location, type, and tax information
   - Entity services and tax jurisdictions can be configured via the Entity Config modal
   - Entities can be edited using the Edit Entity modal
   - Entities can be deleted using the Delete Confirmation dialog

3. **Entity Configuration:**
   - Services tab: Lists all services available for the entity's country
   - Each service can be marked as "Required" and "Subscribed" (subscription requires the service to be required first)
   - Changes are persisted when the Save button is clicked
   - If the entity is VAT-registered, a Tax Jurisdictions tab is shown
   - Tax jurisdictions tab: Allows selection of applicable tax jurisdictions for the entity
   - Tax jurisdictions are filtered by the entity's country and state if applicable

4. **Business Rules:**
   - Service subscription requires the service to be marked as required first
   - Tax jurisdictions are only configurable for VAT-registered entities
   - Tax jurisdictions must match the entity's country
   - Entity types must match the entity's country
   - States must match the entity's country

### Tasks Module Flow
1. **Task Management:**
   - Tasks are displayed in a filterable list view with columns for key information
   - Tasks can be filtered by status, assignee, and category for easier management
   - Two primary task types: Administrative and Revenue tasks
   - Administrative tasks are for internal firm purposes and have simplified form fields
   - Revenue tasks are linked to clients, entities, and services and include compliance and invoicing information

2. **Task Creation Process:**
   - Administrative Tasks:
     - Entry of basic task information (Task Type, Assignee, Due Date)
     - Optional selection of Administrative Task Category
     - Entry of Task Details and Next To Do information
     - On submission, task is created with status "New" (rank 1)
   
   - Revenue Tasks (Three-Tab Form):
     - Basic Information Tab:
       - Client selection (dropdown from client list)
       - Entity selection (dropdown filtered by selected client)
       - Service selection (dropdown filtered by selected entity's subscribed services)
       - Task Category, Task Type, Assignee, Due Date, Task Details, Next To Do
     - Compliance Configuration Tab:
       - Compliance Frequency selection (5 Years to One Time)
       - Conditional Year(s) field (single year for Annual, comma-separated years for multi-year frequencies)
       - Dynamic Duration dropdown based on frequency (e.g., Q1-Q4 for Quarterly, Jan-Dec for Monthly)
       - Compliance Start Date with date picker
       - Auto-calculated End Date based on frequency and start date
       - Recurring task toggle for scheduling future task instances
     - Invoice Information Tab:
       - Currency auto-populated from entity's country (defaulting to USD in current implementation)
       - Service Rate auto-populated from selected service type
       - Both Currency and Service Rate remain editable for flexibility

### Finance Module Flow
1. **Invoice Management:**
   - Invoices can be manually created or automatically generated from completed revenue tasks
   - Invoice creation includes calculation of taxes and discounts with automatic totaling of line items
   - Invoices follow a well-defined status workflow:
     - **Draft**: Initial state when an invoice is created
     - **Sent**: Invoice has been sent to the client
     - **Partially_paid**: Client has made a partial payment
     - **Paid**: Invoice has been fully paid
     - **Overdue**: Due date has passed without full payment
     - **Canceled**: Invoice has been canceled before payment
     - **Void**: Invoice has been voided after being sent
   - Complete tenant isolation is enforced for all invoice operations
   - Automatic calculations ensure financial accuracy with proper decimal handling (precision of 10, scale of 2)
   - UI includes a centralized finance dashboard showing invoices, payments, and chart of accounts in tabs

2. **Invoice Line Items:**
   - Line items are created based on services provided
   - Each line item tracks:
     - Quantity (decimal with precision of 10, scale of 2)
     - Unit price (decimal with precision of 10, scale of 2)
     - Tax rate and tax amount
     - Discount rate and discount amount
     - Line total (calculated as quantity * unit price - discounts + taxes)
   - Optional task reference for each line item enables traceability
   - Sorted presentation maintains consistent display order

3. **Payment Processing:**
   - Payments are recorded against invoices with proper tenant isolation
   - Multiple payment methods supported:
     - credit_card: For card-based payments
     - bank_transfer: For wire transfers and ACH
     - direct_debit: For automated withdrawals
     - cash: For in-person payments
     - check: For traditional check payments
     - paypal: For PayPal gateway payments
     - stripe: For Stripe gateway payments
     - other: For custom payment methods
   - Payments automatically update invoice status:
     - When partial payment is made: status → partially_paid
     - When full payment is completed: status → paid
   - Payment tracking includes:
     - Payment date and amount
     - Reference numbers for reconciliation
     - Notes for additional context
     - Creation tracking for audit purposes

4. **Chart of Accounts:**
   - Comprehensive chart of accounts with five standard types:
     - **Asset**: Resources owned by the business (e.g., accounts receivable)
     - **Liability**: Obligations owed by the business (e.g., tax payable)
     - **Equity**: Ownership accounts (e.g., retained earnings)
     - **Revenue**: Income accounts (e.g., service revenue)
     - **Expense**: Cost accounts (e.g., operating expenses)
   - Hierarchical account structure with four levels:
     - **Main Group**: Balance Sheet or Income Statement (Profit & Loss)
     - **Element Group**: Major categories (Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenues, Expenses)
     - **Sub-Element Group**: Sub-categories (Current Assets, Non-Current Assets, etc.)
     - **Detailed Group**: Specific account groups (Cash & Banks, Accounts Receivable, etc.)
   - Radio buttons for Main Group selection (Balance Sheet or Profit & Loss) at top of interface
   - Each account ("AC Head") has:
     - Automatically generated account code based on hierarchy
     - Descriptive account name
     - Account type (asset, liability, equity, revenue, expense)
     - Activity status flag for temporary deactivation
   - Built-in constraints prevent duplicate account codes/names
   - Complete tenant isolation with dual-layer protection:
     - Database-level filtering using tenant ID in queries
     - Frontend client-side filtering as additional security measure
   - Soft delete approach (marking isActive=false instead of physical deletion)
   - Account CRUD operations tied to proper tenant context

5. **Payment Gateway Integration:**

     - Tenants can configure multiple gateways simultaneously
     - Each gateway can be enabled/disabled independently
     - Gateway selection available at payment time

### Users Module Flow
1. **User Management:**
   - Users are displayed in a list view with key information such as name, email, and active status
   - The SuperAdmin user (tenant owner) is visible in the list with a special indicator
   - Users can be added through the Add User modal with form validation
   - Users can be edited using the Edit User modal
   - Users can be deleted with confirmation dialog (except the current logged-in user)

2. **User Permissions:**
   - Each user can be assigned specific permissions for different modules
   - Permission control includes:
     - View permission: User can see the module
     - Create permission: User can add new items
     - Edit permission: User can modify existing items
     - Delete permission: User can remove items
   - Permissions are module-specific and can be configured granularly
   - SuperAdmin users automatically have all permissions

3. **Business Rules:**
   - Users belong to a specific tenant (accounting firm)
   - Each user can have department and designation assignments
   - Users cannot modify their own permissions
   - SuperAdmin permissions cannot be revoked or modified
   - Users can be deactivated without being deleted

4. **User Creation Flow:**
   - Multi-step wizard process with three tabs:
     - Step 1: Basic Information (Name, Department, Designation)
     - Step 2: Access Permissions (Module-by-module permission assignment)
     - Step 3: Credentials (Username, Email, Password, Active Status)
   - Username, display name, and email are required fields
   - Password must meet minimum security requirements (8+ characters)
   - Department and designation selections are optional
   - Active status is enabled by default
   - Upon creation, users are assigned permissions based on the configuration in step 2

5. **Permission Assignment Flow:**
   - Three-tier permission model per module:
     - Full Access: Automatically grants all CRUD permissions
     - Partial Access: Allows granular selection of individual permissions
     - Restricted Access: Denies all permissions for that module
   - For Partial Access, individual CRUD permissions can be toggled:
     - View (Read): User can see module content
     - Create: User can add new items
     - Edit (Update): User can modify existing items
     - Delete: User can remove items
   - Changes are saved immediately for each permission update
   - Module-specific access means a user might have full permissions in one area but limited in another
   - SuperAdmin users always have all permissions which cannot be modified

## Current Challenges
1. **Task Creation Type Mismatch:**
   - There's a type mismatch between the frontend forms and backend schema for some fields:
   - Frontend sends `taskCategoryId` as a string, but backend expects a number
   - Similar type conversion issues with various ID fields (clientId, entityId, etc.)
   - Resolution: Need to update form submission logic to properly convert types

2. **TypeScript Type Errors in Task Details Component:**
   - There are multiple TypeScript errors in the task-details.tsx component:
   - Parameters in filter callbacks like `taskStatuses.find(s => s.id === task.statusId)` have implicit any types
   - Unknown type errors for collections: taskStatuses, users, taskCategories, clients, etc.
   - Need to add proper type annotations to the component

3. **Task Assignment Notification System:**
   - No notification system exists for when tasks are assigned to users
   - Need to implement email or in-app notifications for task assignments and due date reminders

3. **Task Status Transitions:**
   - ✅ Implemented configurable task status workflow with rules-based transitions
   - ✅ Added a visual interface for configuring allowed/restricted status transitions
   - ✅ Created status change dropdown in task list for quick status updates
   - ✅ Implemented differential treatment of tasks with workflow restrictions applying only to Revenue Tasks (Admin Tasks can transition freely)
   - ✅ Default behavior set to "Allow all transitions unless explicitly forbidden" for intuitive use
   - ✅ Integrated workflow configuration UI as a tab within Task Statuses section for seamless setup
   - ✅ Changed workflow UI to use "Restrict" toggle instead of "Allow" to better reflect its purpose

## Recent UI Improvements (April 2025)

1. **Enhanced Sidebar Navigation:**
   - ✅ Implemented a collapsible sidebar for better space management on desktop

3. **Layout Optimization:**
   - ✅ Improved main content area spacing and padding across all breakpoints
   - ✅ Added proper z-index handling to prevent overlay issues
   - ✅ Implemented responsive layout adjustments for all viewport sizes
   - ✅ Applied consistent shadow effects for visual depth
   - ✅ Enhanced border usage for clear visual separation between components

4. **Technical UI Improvements:**
   - ✅ Leveraged Tailwind utilities more effectively with `cn()` utility function
   - ✅ Used conditional classNames with the `cn()` function for responsive behavior
   - ✅ Implemented responsive design patterns with mobile-first approach
   - ✅ Added appropriate ARIA attributes for better accessibility

## Known Technical Issues

1. **Type Mismatches in Database Storage Interface:**
   - Several TypeScript errors exist in server/database-storage.ts related to interface mismatch with IStorage
   - Missing methods in DatabaseStorage: setTenantSetting, getUserPermissions, getUserPermission, getUserPermissionById
   - Incorrect method signatures in multiple functions, especially for parameter types
   - Error with `where` function not being recognized on Drizzle query objects

2. **React Promise Object Rendering:**
   - Persisting issue with "[object Promise]" appearing in React components when handling async operations
   - Partially fixed in invoice creation but still appears in some cases
   - Possible solutions include better async/await handling and proper Promise resolution before rendering

3. **Drizzle ORM Integration:**
   - Several TypeScript errors in database layer related to Drizzle ORM functions
   - Some type definitions may need updates to match latest Drizzle version
   - Type "'partial'" is not assignable to type '"draft" | "sent" | "partially_paid" | "paid" | "overdue" | "canceled" | "void"
