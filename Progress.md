1. Zod schema validation (shared/schema.ts)
2. Storage interface implementation (server/database-storage.ts)
3. API route with permission middleware (server/routes.ts)
4. Frontend component with TanStack Query
5. Error handling with user-friendly messages
```

### Multi-Tenant Pattern
```
1. Database queries always include tenantId filter
2. Session management with tenant isolation
