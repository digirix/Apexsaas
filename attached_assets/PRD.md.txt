Product Requirements Document: Accounting Firm Management Application
1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for the Accounting Firm Management Application, a multi-tenant web application designed to streamline operations for accounting firms. The application will provide comprehensive modules for managing clients, entities, services, tasks, compliance, internal users, basic finances, and workflow automation. A key differentiator is the deep integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Google Gemini, to provide intelligent assistance, enhance decision-making, facilitate actions, and enable continuous system improvement through enforced learning. The system will also feature a dedicated, secure portal for client access.
2. Goals & Objectives
Streamline Operations: Provide a unified platform to manage core accounting firm workflows, reducing manual effort and disparate systems.
Enhance Efficiency: Leverage AI and workflow automation to improve task management, compliance tracking, and service delivery.
Improve Decision Making: Utilize AI suggestions and organized data presentation to help users make informed decisions regarding client services, compliance, and task prioritization.
Facilitate Compliance: Implement robust tracking of compliance requirements linked to client entities and services, including recurring task generation.
Enable Collaboration: Provide role-based access for internal team members (Members) under the supervision of a Super Admin.
Improve Client Communication: Offer a secure Client Portal for clients to view relevant information about their services and tasks.
Support Financial Tracking: Include basic invoicing and payment tracking capabilities linked to completed tasks and services.
Ensure Scalability & Security: Build a secure, multi-tenant architecture capable of handling individual firm growth.
3. Target Audience / User Personas
Super Admin: The primary user who signs up the firm (tenant). Has full access to all modules, configures the system (Setup, Settings), manages users (Members) and their permissions, approves recurring tasks, manages API keys, and oversees all tenant data.
Member: An internal employee of the accounting firm. Access and capabilities are determined by permissions set by the Super Admin. Performs day-to-day tasks related to clients, task management, etc., within their allowed scope.
Client Contact: An authorized contact person for a specific client firm. Accesses the secure, read-only Client Portal using their unique credentials (managed by the Super Admin/authorized Members). Can view information pertinent only to their associated Client record (Entities, Tasks, Services, Profile).
4. Assumptions
The application will be developed using Replit as the primary environment.
The database will be Replit's PostgreSQL. Scalability and production limitations of this choice need ongoing evaluation.
Google Gemini 2.5 Pro will be the AI model, accessed via API.
Stripe and PayPal will be the integrated payment gateways.
Users require a modern web browser to access the application and client portal.
Basic internet connectivity is required for all users and API interactions.
5. Functional Requirements

5.10. AI Requirements (Consolidated)
Model: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (via API).
Goal: Assist users, improve efficiency, enable learning.
Core Functions:
Suggestions (Clearly Labeled, Non-Binding):
Required Services for an Entity (Clients Module) based on Country, State, Type, VAT status.
Task Details for Revenue Tasks (Tasks Module) based on Client, Entity, Service, history.


Potential Future Actions (User Confirmation Recommended): Auto-task categorization, draft communications, risk identification, workflow optimization.
Enforced Learning:
Goal: Improve AI suggestions and workflow efficiency over time.
Data Sources: User actions within the app, direct feedback (e.g., rating suggestions - if implemented), contextual data, potentially anonymized external data (if integrated securely).
Mechanisms: Monitor AI performance, incorporate feedback loops. Specific technical implementation requires further design. Privacy/anonymization critical.




Management (AI Assistance Management - Section in Settings or Setup):
Enable/disable specific AI features (suggestions).
Potentially adjust suggestion sensitivity/confidence.
View logs of significant AI suggestions/actions (transparency).


Security: Secure storage and use of Google Gemini API Key (Settings Module). AI processing must respect data privacy and tenant isolation.
6. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: Application should be responsive under typical load for a small-to-medium accounting firm. Task generation, reporting, and AI API calls should execute within acceptable time limits. Workflow execution should not unduly impact overall system performance.
Scalability: Architecture should support adding new tenants and growth in data volume per tenant (Clients, Tasks). Database performance needs monitoring (especially Replit PostgreSQL limitations).
Security:
Authentication & Authorization: Secure password handling, robust session/token management, strict enforcement of role-based permissions at the API level.
Data Isolation: Prevent any possibility of data leakage between tenants.
API Security: Secure storage and handling of external API keys (Gemini, Stripe, PayPal). Protect against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
Client Portal Security: Ensure Client Contacts can only access their own data.


Usability: Intuitive navigation, clear labeling, consistent UI patterns. AI suggestions should be helpful and easy to understand/action. Error messages should be informative.
Reliability: The system should be available during expected usage hours. Recurring task generation and workflow execution should be reliable. Implement robust error handling for API calls and background processes.
Maintainability: Code should be well-structured, commented, and follow good practices. Modular design should facilitate updates and bug fixing.
7. Design & UX Considerations
Clear visual separation and branding for the Client Portal vs. the internal Firm application.
Use of tabbed interfaces for complex forms (e.g., Add Revenue Task).
Dynamic filtering of dropdowns based on context (e.g., States by Country, Services by Country).
Conditional display of fields based on user input (e.g., VAT ID).
Consider UI patterns for managing lists with CRUD operations (inline actions, modals, dedicated pages).
Provide clear feedback to the user after actions (e.g., success/error messages).
AI suggestions should be presented unobtrusively, allowing users to easily accept or ignore them.
8. Release Criteria (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)
Functional Multi-Tenant Signup & Firm Login.
Functional User Management (Super Admin can add Members, basic permissions).
Full CRUD for Setup Module core items (Country, Currency, State, Entity Type, Service Type, Task Statuses/Categories).
Functional Client & Entity CRUD (Clients Module).
Functional Service Subscription configuration (Required/Subscribed - Clients Module).
Functional Task CRUD (Admin & Revenue Tasks - Basic Info Tab, Manual Status Updates).
Basic AI Suggestion for Required Services (Clients Module).
Basic AI Suggestion for Task Details (Tasks Module).
Secure API Key storage for Gemini (Settings Module).
Core application structure and navigation functional.
9. Future Considerations / Out of Scope (for V1.0)
Advanced Reporting & Analytics Dashboards.
Direct Integration with external accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero, etc.).
Client Portal: Document upload/management, direct task interaction/comments.
Advanced AI Actions (auto-communication drafting, proactive risk alerts without confirmation).
Mobile Application.
Time Tracking features beyond basic service billing basis.
Full Budgeting/Financial Planning features.
Email integration for notifications/sending invoices (beyond basic Pay Now link concept).
10. Open Issues / Questions
Detailed field specification and workflow design for the Finance Management Module.
Specific technical implementation details for the AI "enforced learning" mechanism and feedback loops.
Detailed error handling strategy for external API calls (Gemini, Payment Gateways) and background jobs (recurring tasks, workflows).
Final decision on data exposure in Client Portal Task view (Task Details, Next To Do).
Specific password complexity rules.
Need to define relationships (e.g., Manager) in User Management if required for workflow actions.
Confirmation of backend/frontend technology stack choice within Replit.

This PRD provides a comprehensive translation of your scope into requirements. It should serve as a solid foundation for the AI agent to begin development, referencing back to the original scope document for any fine-grained details or clarifications when needed.
