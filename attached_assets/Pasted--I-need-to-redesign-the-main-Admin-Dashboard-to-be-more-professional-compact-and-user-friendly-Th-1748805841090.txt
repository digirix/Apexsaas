 I need to redesign the main Admin Dashboard to be more professional, compact, and user-friendly. The current dashboard (as seen in the screenshots) requires too much scrolling and lacks clear prioritization of information.

Here's the direction:

1.  **Overall Layout Goal:** Aim for a dashboard that presents the most critical information "above the fold" or within minimal scrolling (e.g., 1.5 screen heights max). Utilize a multi-column layout (e.g., 2 or 3 columns for main content rows) to make better use of horizontal space. Reduce the vertical height of individual components.

2.  **Top Row (Critical Overview & KPIs):**
    *   Consolidate the top summary cards. I want a maximum of 4-5 highly impactful KPI cards.
    *   Create a primary "Actionable Alerts" KPI combining overdue tasks and very urgent compliance deadlines (e.g., due in <3 days). Make this visually prominent.
    *   Other KPIs could be 'Total Active Tasks,' 'Overall Compliance Health %,' and one key client-related metric.
    *   Ensure these KPIs are clickable to navigate to relevant detailed views.

3.  **Main Content Area (Structured in Columns):**
    *   **Primary Column: 'Task & Workflow Hub' Card:**
        *   This card should use a tabbed interface (using Shadcn/UI tabs).
        *   Tab 1: 'Priorities' - A concise list of tasks that are critical or due very soon (today/this week). This should replace the separate 'Priority Matrix' and 'Urgent Items' widgets.
        *   Tab 2: 'Status Snapshot' - A compact version of the 'Status Distribution' pie/donut chart with a brief text summary.
        *   Tab 3: 'Recent Activity' - A scrollable feed of recent task updates.
    *   **Secondary Column: 'Compliance & Client Insights' Card:**
        *   This card should highlight 'Compliance Hotspots' â€“ a list of a few clients/entities with the most urgent compliance issues or upcoming deadlines.
        *   Include a compact way to show 'Key Client/Entity Activity' (e.g., entities with most recent task updates or highest task volume).
    *   **(Optional Third Column/Smaller Card): 'Team Performance Snapshot'** - Show only 1-2 very high-level team metrics like overall completion rate. Detailed team performance and leaderboards should be moved to a separate report or a dedicated 'Team' section.

4.  **Component Adjustments:**
    *   For charts (like 'Task Workflow Analytics' bar chart or 'Status Distribution' pie chart), make them more compact. Reduce padding, consider smaller font sizes for labels if legible.
    *   The 'Quick Actions' component is good, keep it accessible, perhaps in the top bar or as a floating action button if that fits the UI style.

5.  **Information to Move/De-emphasize from Main Dashboard:**
    *   The detailed 'Task Lifecycle Analytics' list (showing individual tasks with progress bars) should be removed from the main dashboard. This level of detail belongs in the Tasks module.
    *   The 'Member Performance Leaderboard' should be moved to a dedicated reporting area.
    *   Remove redundant widgets like multiple priority matrices if their information is consolidated.
    *   The large weekly calendar view for tasks should be replaced by the 'Priorities' list, with a link to the full Compliance Calendar module.

6.  **Data Sources:** You should be able to leverage all existing data fetching logic (`useQuery` hooks for `/api/v1/clients`, `/api/v1/tasks`, `/api/v1/invoices`, etc.). The main change is in how this data is *presented* and *summarized* on the dashboard.

7.  **UI Library:** Continue using Shadcn/UI components for a consistent look and feel. Focus on their more compact variants or configure them to reduce padding/margins where appropriate.

Please refactor the existing `Dashboard.tsx` (or relevant dashboard component file) to implement these changes. Prioritize clarity, conciseness, and actionability for the user. Let's make the dashboard a powerful overview, not an exhaustive list."
